# Overview
Created based on My Hierarchy for Colored Header feature, since we use other plugin for the hierarchy that suits our needs but that plugin doesn't have colored header.

(Disclaimer: the preview is mixed with [vHierarchy](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/vhierarchy-2-251320))

My Hierarchy header is awesome so we create our own based on that.
